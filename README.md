## About This Boilerplate

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
